# File_copy
In this project I had to read all the files from a given directory and categorise them with respect to their type i.e pdfs,txt,jpg etc.
The program would create a new directory for each type and store all the file in their respective type directories.
This project helped me learn about directory creation and modification through code and also introduced me to makefile.

The In directory contains all the files. This is the directory which has to be read.

The Out directory will contain all the sub directories of the respective type.

The include directory contains all the .h files.

The src contains all .c and .o files.
